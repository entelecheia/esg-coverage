project_description: This study investigates the role of financial analysts in disseminating
    Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) information to the market and its
    subsequent impact on stock performance. While the direct causal relationship between
    ESG ratings and analyst coverage remains unclear, we propose that analysts serve
    as an informational pathway, translating ESG ratings into stock performance. Using
    panel data analysis, we examine the relationship between ESG ratings, analyst
    coverage, and stock performance. Our findings suggest that companies with higher
    ESG ratings do not necessarily attract more analyst coverage, but the coverage
    they receive plays a crucial role in shaping investor perceptions and influencing
    stock performance. This research highlights the importance of financial analysts
    in the ESG ecosystem and underscores the need for more comprehensive and accurate
    coverage of ESG topics. Our findings have implications for companies, investors,
    and policymakers interested in sustainable investing and corporate social responsibility.
